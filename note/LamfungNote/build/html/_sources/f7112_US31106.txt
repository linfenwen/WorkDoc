F7112 : US31106 Provide Architecture Design For MP4 Local Recording
===================================================================

Acceptence Critaria
-------------------
#. Get the agreement of the whole architecture design among WME, Walker, Won, Nemo, Parker who related with this feature.Â  And deliver the design before sprint demo.
#. List all of the stories for this feature in Rally based on above agreement.
#. Provide the estimation of the release day before sprint demo. Need get cross team's estimation and commitment also.

Based On WME MP4 Local Recording Overview

Design FQA
----------



#. In-meeting case, why we suggest use a new process to do mp4 local recording work but not in the meeting process?

#. In-meeting case, why we suggest to capture data in meeting process?
	+ VOIP data always from meeting process
	+ Performance consider
	
#. MP4 Audio codec: OPUS or AAC?
	+ Confirmed with Keith, Audio Engine can provide PCM data

#. WME need provide audio mixing API or not?
	+ If provide, the logic will be simple in MP4 Local recording client side
	+ Else, need create several audio track and map the audio data
	+ Legacy VOIP
	+ Hybrid VOIP
	+ TSP VOIP

#. How to handle resolution change?

#. WME support pause or resume?

#. WME provide H264 encode API?

#. High resolution concerns?
	+ CPU usage
	+ Disk usage
	+ FPS
	+ Fixed code stream
	+ UI

#. Create a process without UI, call WME API to retrieve H264 and AAC data, then generate a MP4 file
	+ As a developer, I can call WME API to retrieve image data
	+ As a developer, I can call WME API to encode image raw data and output H264 data
	+ As an audio data user, I can call **MP4 Creator Module** to generate MP4 file
		- Need Parker to provide **MP4 Creator Module**	
	+ As a developer, I can call WME API to retrieve audio data
		- Need WME team provide a training or document to introduce relevant API or sample code
	+ As a video data user, I call call **MP4 Creator Module** to generate MP4 file
	+ As an audio data and video data user, I can call **MP4 Creator Module** to generate MP4 file
	
#. Create a process with UI, which use WCL as UI Library, it's can record a specify process.
	+ As a developer, I can use WCL to complete **Webex Recorder** Window
		- Need UI team provide UI design
	+ As a developer, I can use WCL to complete **Save Webex Recording** Window
	+ As a developer, I can use **WME API** to retrieve **Open Application Lists**
		- Need WME team provide support
	+ As a developer, I can use WCL to complete **Webex Recorder-Open Application** Window
	+ As a developer, I can response the command from **Webex Recorder** Window
	+ As a developer, I can use WCL to complete **Recorder Panel** Window
		- Need UI team provide UI design
	+ As a developer, I can response the command from **Recorder Panel** Window
	+ As a developer, I can use WCL to complete the **Audio Setup Wizard** Window
	+ As a developer, I can response the command from **Audio Setup Wizard** Window
#. Create a process with UI, which use WCL as UI Library, it's can record meeting process.
	+ As a developer, I need use feature toggle to enable or disable MP4 Local Recording
	+ As a developer, I can use WCL to create **Save Recorded Meeting As** Window
	+ As a developer, I need define LPC command channel message
	+ As a developer, I need define LPC data channel data format
	+ As a developer, I can call WME API to retrieve audio data
	+ As a developer, I can call WME API to retrieve video data
	+ As a developer, I can send data from Meeting process to **Local Recording** process
	+ As a developer, When **Local Recording** process receive data from **Meeting Process**, I can call **MP4FileCreator** to generate MP4 file
	+ As a developer, When the AS is sharing, I can retrieve audio and video data
	+ As a developer, When the DS is sharing, I can retrieve audio and video data

#. Create a process with UI, which use WCL as UI Library, it's can record meeting process and sync status with meeting process
	+ As a developer, when input different resolution image data, I can output the fixed size image data
	+ As an user, when I click "Recording" button on **Recorder Panel** window, on the meeting process's status bar, it will show "Recording..."
	+ As an user, when I click "Pause" button on **Recorder Panel** window, on the meeting process's status bar, it will show "Meeting recording is paused."
	+ As an user, when I click "Stop" button on **Recorder Panel** window, on the meeting process's status bar, it will back to normal, and the **Webex Recorder** process will be exited.
	
#. Legacy AS or DS MP4 Local Recording support

#. Others
	+ TA
