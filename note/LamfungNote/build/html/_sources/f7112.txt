===============================================

#. 2018.03.21, Hold F7112 first meeting
	+ Learn Local Recording current status
	+ Learn Local Recording history
	+ Meeting Recording
		- https://alpha.webex.com/alpha/lsr.php?RCID=803c4018d4eb492899ed55925b1b649d
		- Recording password: xUTqwJW4
	+ Meeting Minutes
		- Background from Walker
			+ Current WRF file maybe include two type data: DLC and H264
			+ Current WRF Editor can't edit when the WRF file include DLC and H264 data
			+ Many customer complain WRF Editor can't edit WRF file
			
		- Parker said:
			#. Local Recording had two ways
				+ Online Local Recording: WRF file generate by meeting process
				+ Offline Local Recording: WRF file generate by AtAuthor process
			#. Data handle
				+ Local Recording call AS component to capture meeting window
				+ AS component support two different encode logic: DLC and H264
				+ When AS component capture image data it will notify Local Recording through the callback interface, then Local Recording will use WRF data format to record
				+ Local Recording call AudioCC component to capture audio
				+ When AudioCC component capture audio data it will notify Local Recording through the callback interface, then Local Recording will use WRF data format to record
			#. Playback
				+ Local Recording Player parse WRF file
				+ Local Recording Player pass PCM data to AudioCC component base on timestamp, then AudioCC play the audio data
				+ Local Recording Player pass DLC or H264 data to AS component base on timestamp, then AS play the video data 
			#. Others
				+ WOT.h defined WRF header format, key frame format
				+ Every 1 minute will generate one key frame
		- Titus said:
			#. He had dumped image data from AS component through hard code AS code
			#. AS component not just capture meeting process's window, it also capture cursor
			#. He had also given some suggestion from AS side
				

#. US29571: Understand current local recording background knowledge
	+ Task
		- Provide support from AS side
		- Provide support from AtAuthor side
		- How current AtAuthor work
	+ Output
		- Document current local recording work's logic 
		- Define what will do in the next sprint

Plan
----

Parker
------

#. AtAuthor.exe
#. Local Recording call AS
#. Local Recording call Audio
#. Every one munite will create one key frame
#. WRF Header
#. WOT.h, Key Frame Format
#. PlayBack can play WRF file
#. According Timestamp, as and audio 

Online Recording
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Just Recording meeting window
#. Customer select file format
#. audiocc
#. ARF: 


Capture
~~~~~~~

#. AS
#. WME, HFPS

Q & A
~~~~~

#. How to record video
#. How to record chat
#. How AtAuthor.exe comunicate with meeting process?
#. Offline switch to Online
#. AS H264 data, just picture
#. DLC or H264, dump H264 data, mp4 or not
#. If use AS, need consider DLC or H264
#. If use other method to capture picture, need consider cursor
